                <p>The gameplay of The Wizard Always Wins consists of 7 different actions, or "Roles" that players can choose from. These roles allow players to draw element cards, draw tokens, or play element cards. Once a player has chosen a role, no other player can choose that role for that round. The roles that the players choose determines the players' turn order for the next round.</p>

                <p>After the player has chosen a role and taken their actions, they turn in any completed element sets. Element sets can be completed by having the required amount of cards or tokens for that specific element. Once the set is completed the player may level up or add one of their gems to the token bag, or sometimes both, depending on the element. Once all players have taken turns completing these steps, the round ends, the player roles are returned to the table, and the turn order for the next round is determined.</p>

                <p>Players win the game by selecting the Wizard role and drawing one of their player tokens from the bag. The Wizard draws a number of tokens based on the players current level. If a player chooses the wizard role and does not draw their own token out of the bag, the player returns the drawn tokens to the bag and play continues with that player going last in the next round.</p>

                </div>
                <p>The gameplay is pretty simple and straightforward. The only choices the player has are which of the seven roles to choose. The variability in the roles comes from how many element cards or tokens you draw. The rules and general gameplay could be learned and explained relatively quickly for most players.</p>

            <div class="theme">
                <h3>Theme</h3>
                <p>The fantasy theme does not really stand out while playing the game. The names of the roles could be swapped or changed and the game would still feel exactly the same. The elements seem like randomly chosen items and do not relate to their set rewards. Luckily this game does not rely on the theme to have an enjoyable experience.</p>

            <div class="overall">
                <h3>Overall</h3>
                <p>The Wizard Always Wins could serve as an introduction to some modern board game concepts, such as resource management, but this game lacks depth. At two players you mostly alternate turns selecting the two most powerful roles until one of you decides to try to end the game. At player counts of three or more, a little more strategy is introduced since you have to be more selective with the roles. You may pick a more powerful role but that means you will be choosing your role after everyone else the next round. This game could work fine as a filler game to entertain for a few minutes, but the lack of depth or any real decision making does not make it one that we are itching to get back to the table.</p>
